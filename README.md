# Chrome-Assist

Chrome-Assist is a powerful, on-device Chrome extension powered by Gemini Nano that provides seamless text assistance capabilities. With a few keyboard shortcuts, users can summarize, translate, rewrite, and compose text directly within their Chrome browser.

- **Translate Text**: Instantly translate selected text into a wide range of supported languages.
- **Rewrite Text**: Adjust the tone or style of selected text for different contexts.
- **Compose Text**: Generate new content with formal, neutral, or casual tones in customizable lengths and formats.
